DataStage
=========

This is a fork of the DataStage project. The original one can be found on https://github.com/dataflow/DataStage.

The main goals of this fork are:
 - adding support for multiple projects on one DataStage server
 - running DataStage python code in a pithon virtual environment

Some additional items, which would be nice to have:
 - mainstreaming the installation process from a debian package, includinc promtping for some installation parameters
 - porting to newer versions of Django and Ubuntu
----------

This project is part of the `DataFlow Project <http://www.dataflow.ox.ac.uk/>`_,
aiming to create a two-stage data management infrastructure. DataStage allows
research groups to manage research data locally, which can then be pushed to
an institutional data repository.
