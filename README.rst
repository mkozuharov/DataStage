DataStage
=========

This project is part of the `DataFlow Project <http://www.dataflow.ox.ac.uk/>`_,
aiming to create a two-stage data management infrastructure. DataStage allows
research groups to manage research data locally, which can then be pushed to
an institutional data repository.

Development
-----------

The DataStage code is hosted `on GitHub
<https://github.com/dataflow/DataStage>`_.

The developer mailing list is hosted `by Google Groups
<http://groups.google.com/group/dataflow-devel>`_. You can subscribe by
