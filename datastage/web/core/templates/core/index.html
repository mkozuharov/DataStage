<p>{{ settings.SITE_NAME  }} <span class="version">{{ settings.SITE_VERSION }}</span>provides a platform to manage your research data that ensures your data is secure, access-controlled and back-up.  {{ settings.SITE_NAME }} also enables you to create data packages for submission to a repository, providing long-term preservation, data embargoing and a Digital object identifier (DOI) for that data package.
